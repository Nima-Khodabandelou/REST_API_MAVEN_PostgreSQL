# REST_API_MAVEN_PostgreSQL
##
Developing API for student management system using Java Spring framework along with Maven and PostgreSQL. 
REST architecture is used for API development.
Hibernate is utilized as ORM and data is persisted in PostgreSQL database.
Also, Maven is chosen for building the project. Steps are as follows:
##
A repository is created on GitHub containing Licence, Readme, and gitignore (for Java) files.
##
The repo is cloned to hard-drive on a specific folder.
##
The Spring JAR file is generated on https://start.spring.io website considering relevant
  dependencies (i.e. Spring Boot Devtools, Spring Web, PostgreSQL Driver, and Spring Data JPA).
##  
The generated JAR file is extracted in the project folder on hard-drive.
##
Using an appropriate IDE (Intellij Idea in our case), the project folder is opened and the newly added
  files are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo.
##  
The project is pre-configured by Spring Boot under the hood and several files and folders are available 
  to start the software development process.
##  
The developer may use H2 in-memory database instead of external RDMS such as PostgreSQL in order to be
  completely focused on the backend (and frontend if any) section(s) of the project and external RDMS 
  would be considered later on; however, this is not the case with our development approach.
